# WireMock

WireMock is a flexible and powerful library used for mocking HTTP-based APIs. It allows developers to simulate API responses, enabling:

- Testing applications without relying on live services.
- Creating controlled scenarios for various edge cases.
- Verifying the HTTP requests made by an application.

By mimicking real API behavior, WireMock helps improve test reliability and development speed.

## Fluent Assertions with WireMock
Fluent Assertions is a library that provides a clean and expressive syntax for writing assertions in tests. When used with WireMock, it allows:

- Clear validation of request expectations and API behavior.
- Readable and maintainable test code.
